#Yet to do the computational part

#GWAS - Genome Wide Association Studies

#We try to find the relationship between Phenotypes and Genotypes
#Phenotypes can be both simply mendellian and influenced by one gene and also be very very abstracted like how rich someone is and is there a genetic correlation to it

#side note: in most cases the genome impacts the phenotype, but sometimes, in very edge cases the reverse can happen too! insane!

#in GWAS we correlate the genome to phenotype using linear regression
#what we want to do is find out what parts of the genome are affecting our phenotype and not the code of genome itself


#y∼βx+e


#y represents the phenotypes
#∼ reads as correlated to
#β is the effect of a SNP (this is basically the slope -- what we are solving for)
#x is the SNP/genotype/QTL/Loci
#e represents the error or effect of the environment

#basicallt the higher the β, the higher the correlation. 1 represents perfect correlation
