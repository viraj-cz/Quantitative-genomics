# Quantitative-genomics
Self teaching myself topics in quantitative genomics. These are just unstructured public notes, mostly for myself, and if someone finds it helpful.

there are obviously going to be so many mistakes in this and gap in my understanding, so reach me out if you see one!

Tutorial I am following: [https://rawgit.com/uqrmaie1/statgen_equations/master/statgen_equations.html#snp-effects---basics](https://rawgit.com/uqrmaie1/statgen_equations/master/statgen_equations.html#snp-effects---basics)

Also adding helpful resources, I come across:
